            <h2>Cumberland Gap's history in the Civil War</h2>
            <p>
                The Cumberland Gap played a significant role during the American Civil War. Its strategic location made it a crucial point of interest for both the Union and Confederate forces.
                Before the Civil War, the Cumberland Gap was already well-known as a natural passage through the mountains. Native American tribes, including the Shawnee and Cherokee, used the gap as a trade route for centuries.
                When the Civil War broke out in 1861, control over the Cumberland Gap became important for both sides. The Union recognized the strategic value of the gap as it provided a potential invasion route into the heartland of the Confederacy. Confederate troops, on the other hand, saw the gap as a defensive position to protect their territories.
                The town changed hands several times throughout the war but ultimately was held by the Union forces. The people native to the area were mostly pro-Union, a rare sight in the South.
